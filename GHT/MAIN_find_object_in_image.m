function [Ismarked,Iborders,Ybest,Xbest, ItmAng, BestScore]= MAIN_find_object_in_image(Is,Itm)
%{
Find an object that fit Template Itm in image Is.
The orientation of the template and the object in the image does not have to be the same as that as the template. 
The template Itm is matched to the image Is in various of rotations and the best match is chosen. 
The function use  Generalized Hough transforms to match the template to the
image.

Input (Essential):
Is: Color image with the object to be found.
Itm: Template of the object to be found. The template is written as binary image with the boundary of the template marked 1(white) and all the rest of the pixels marked 0. 

Output
Ismarked: The image (Isresize) with the template marked upon it in the location of and size of the best match.
Iborders: Binary image of the borders of the template/object in its scale and located in the place of the best match on the image. 
Ybest Xbest: location on the image (in pixels) were the template were found to give the best score (location the top left pixel of the template Itm in the image).
ItmAng: The rotation angle of  the template in degrees that give the best match
BestScore: Score of the best match found in the scan (the score of the output).

Algorithm:
The function rotate the template Itm in various of angles and for each rotation search for the template in the image. 
The angle and location in the image that gave the best match for the template are chosen.
